# Experiments

These experiments include tests and comparisons such as determining the
scalability or accuracy of an algorithm.

To run all of the experiments, do
```bash
$ ./run_all
```

Because this may take a very long time, it is better to write the progress of
the script to a file:
```bash
$ ./run_all &> progress &
```
